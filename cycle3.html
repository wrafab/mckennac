  <h1>Cycle 3</h1>
		<h2>What I did</h2>
		<br></br>
		<h3> This cycle, we are learning about garment printing, uv printing, and sublimation. Our first challenge </h3>
		<h3> this cycle is to make a shirt that has something to do with Hudson. I am making a shirt that says "HUDSON" </h3>
   		<h3> and an outline of Ohio will be in the middle, with the clock tower on Hudson. The shirt came out very well. </h3>

		<h3> The second class I made and printed some flip flops with American flag by sublimation. Sublimation is when </h3>
		<h3> you heat the ink on paper hot enough to make it a gas, it transfers to the print surface, and cools into a solid again </h3>
   		<h3> My design turned out very well and transferred better than I could've asked. </h3>

   		<h3> Finally, I made a golf ball that says "DAMN." on it because after 90% of my hits I say "damn" because I am bad. </h3>
		<h3> This was put no the golf ball through UV printing. It took about 15 minutes total. </h3>
