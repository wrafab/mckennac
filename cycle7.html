  <h1>Cycle 7</h1>
		<h2>What I did</h2>
		<br></br>
		<h3> This week was a fun week in Digital Fab. We had to make a longboard and CNC Mill a mold for chocolate. </h3>
   		<h3> I have not filled my mold with chocolate, but my longboard is finished and turned out very well. </h3>

		<h3> I decided I wanted an outer space theme, so I spray painted the whole thing myself, then ordered some purple
			wheels with black trucks to complete the look. </h3>
		<h3> I didn't run into any difficulties or serious problems, my only setbacks were waiting for the paint booth
			to be open and having to redrill the holes for my trucks a few times to get the right size.</h3>
