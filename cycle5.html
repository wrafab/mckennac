  <h1>Cycle 5</h1>
		<h2>What I did</h2>
		<br></br>
<h3>The first task of the cycle is to answer these questions: </h3>
<h3>What are the design rules and limitations for the MakerBot Replicator 5th Gen printers?</h3>
	<h3>The rules are that you have to have supports to hold up your structure, and you can't print bigger than the machine.
	<h3> It also helps to put your design on a base. </h3>
<h3>What type of 3D printing process does the MakerBot Replicator use?</h3>
	<h3>The Replicator uses an additive process, by adding heated filament onto itself until the design is created.</h3>
<h3>What are the advantages to this type of printer versus the FormLabs printer?</h3>
	<h3>The advantages are it is cheaper in smaller scale, it is relatively short print time, and easy to maintain. It is also easy to use.</h3>

		<h3> I decided to put my head on a giraffe body. It came out too small, but looked good nonetheless. </h3>
		<h3> For my useful object, I found a Tuba mouthpiece. I changed the bore of the part that goes into </h3>
		<h3> the tuba, as it seemed too small. Again, it came out too small, so it will work better in a trumpet. </h3>
    		<h3> For my object that couldn't be made subtractively, I decided a whistle would fit the bill. 
		<h3> The one I found was said to make sound up to 130db, but the modifications I made gives it a whopping 0db </h3>
		<h3> tone. It finally came out the correct size, but next time I would make it a little louder. </h3>
