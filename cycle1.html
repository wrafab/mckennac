  <h1>Cycle 1</h1>
	<h2>What I did</h2>
	<br></br>
		<h3>In the first cycle of Digital Fab, I did two team events and coded this website in html5. The first challenge</h3>
		<h3>was to build a device of straws to catch a golf ball before it hit the ground, and only 3 straws could</h3>
		<h3>be touching the ground. This challenge was pretty difficult and my grounp did not succeed. The second</h3>
		<h3>challenge was to build the tallest free-standing structure made of only newspaper and tape. My group made</h3>
		<h3>the third tallest structure with out it falling over.</h3>

		<h3>As you can see by the intense focus in the photos, our group was prepared to win. While we may have been</h3>
		<h3>over prepared, we still had fun and learned something</h3>
