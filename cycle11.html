  <h1>Cycle 11</h1>
		<h2>What I did</h2>
		<br></br>
		<h3> This cycle was the time to work on our final project. I decided to make a laptop stand with LED underglow. </h3>
    		<h3> Sadly, I was too focused on the project and forgot to take a whole bunch of pictures, so I only have one of </h3>
		<h3> the completed project. </h3>

		<h3> There were a decent amount of setbacks this time. First, I had to figure out a way to cut the wood to size </h3>
		<h3> without using the band saw because it was making an awful noise. Second, I didn't drill big enough pilot <h3>
		<h3> holes, so my wood cracked at some parts. Third, my LEDs didn't stick with the backing on them, so I had to 
		<h3> tear it off by hand and reglue all of it on. Finally, the way the Bluetooth connects makes it very difficult </h3>
		<h3> to connect while on campus. The problem should be nonexistant at home. </h3>
