  <h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>My name is Colin McKenna, as you have probably found out by now. I am a senior day student from Hudson. I am a captain
       of the baseball team and a three year c-squad basketball starter. In my free time, I enjoy doing things with my car and 
       playing disc golf. I work at Country Maid Ice Cream in Richfield during the weeknights and weekends, and I have been
       there for about a year.</p>
