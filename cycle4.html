  <h1>Cycle 4</h1>
		<h2>What I did</h2>
		<br></br>
		<h3>This cycle was full of mess ups for me. We had been tasked to make a clock using the laser cutter,</h3>
		<h3>make a press fit kit on the engraver, then engrave a glass or water bottle. My clock took 4 attempts</h3>
		<h3>to print correctly. The first time, I cut out too much. The second time I cut out too little. The third</h3>
		<h3>time the power went out half way through. Finally, it worked on the fourth try. It came out as planned</h3>
		<h3>and looks how I want. I also had difficulty making my press fit kit. I did not cut out at all how I wanted.</h3>
		<h3> I also messed up on my cup engraving and the image got wrapped around the sides and it looked terrible.</h3>
